## üìã Documentation

### Handling the data
Lightrent currently allows email and password protection. To do this you just need to change/add IDs to your code. In the email input, add the ID "igrUsername", and in the password input add the ID "igrPassword". Now after setting up the IDs of the inputs, you must add the ID of the button that sends the form. In this button you must add the ID "createIgr".
  
### Getting the data processed
To get the processed data you can use the **igrGetValues()** function. But it is important to know, that by using this function, the user's data will be vulnerable for a millisecond. When using the **igrGetValues()** function you must set the extraction of the encrypted content, like so:
```javascript
let decryptedPassword = decrypt(encryptedPassword);
//Using the email/name
let decryptedUsername = decrypt(encryptedUsername);
```
and so you can get the password in the "decryptedPassword" variable, and the name/email in the decryptedUsername variable.
  
### Saving the data
So far (in the documentation), you have only been taught how to handle and get the data in one session. That is, for example, let's say you want to create a social network, or any other kind of application that has user interaction, you will have to store user information, to display their names, messages, and other interactions. So, for that, you can use the "**igrSave()**" function. This function will create a file on the server with the name defined by the username of the current session (if treated) and the content will be the password. The content will be encrypted. With this you can get this data at any time on the server, making everything possible, like a database, only more secure. But before using the "**igrSave()**" function you need to define your FTP in the "igtFTPpost" variable.
